Create Venv: python -m venv djangovenv
Start Venv: djangovenv\Scripts\activate.bat
Install Django: python -m pip install Django
Create App: python manage.py startapp page-name
Run Server: python manage.py runserver
Next: Create Templates folder
Next: Create a html file inside it
Next: Update Settings to include the new view under INSTALLED APPS
Next: python manage.py migrate
Next: Add a model to models
Next: python manage.py makemigrations projects
Next: python manage.py migrate
Next: Open Python shell - python manage.py shell
Next: from projects.models import Project
Next (View Table): Project.objects.all()
Next (Add to DB): project = Project(name='Pomodoro Timer', video=r'projects\assets\videos\pomodoro-timer-app-clip.mp4', tools='Visual Studio Code, GitHub', skills='Java, JavaFX, SceneBuilder, Version Control', link=r'https://github.com/clarakhumalo/PomodoroTimerApp')
Next (Save changes): project.save()
Next (See if table got member): Project.objects.all().values()
For LOOP: >>> for x in members_list:
...   x.save()

To update a record we have to get it from the DB:
    from projects.models import Project
    save it in a variable (4 is the index) > x = Project.objects.all()[4] 
    x.name will give the projects name
    x.name = "new name" will change it
To delete: x.delete()
(1, {'projects.Project': 1}) tells us how many items were deleted

Update Table (In Models file): simply add it to the function e.g. phone = models.IntegerField() OR joined_date = models.DateField()
ALWAYS make migrations to save changes > python manage.py makemigrations members
This will also prompt you to state whether you want to add defaults or let the values be null
